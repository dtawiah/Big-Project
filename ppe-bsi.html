        <h1 class="brief-title">Proper PPE/BSI</h1>
        <p class="brief-content">
            Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Body Substance Isolation (BSI) are crucial for protecting first responders from hazards.
          PPE is gear worn by EMS personnel to protect themselves from infectious diseases, hazardous materials, and physical dangers. Some PPE include gowns, masks, gloves, etc. 
          The NREMT(National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians), emphasizes that EMS providers must don appropriate PPE before making patient contact, as part of scene size-up and patient assessment.
          BSI A precautionary approach where all bodily fluids are treated as potentially infectious, and PPE is used to prevent exposure. In practice: Use of gloves for any patient contact, eye protection and mask if splash or spray is anticipated.

                        <li>Change gloves between patients.</li>
                        <li>Consider double-gloving in situations with high risk of exposure.</li>
